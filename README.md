**The analysis is done for a travel aggregator that earns revenue from PPC (Pay Per Click) model, i.e., Every time a user clicks the link and traverses into the partner's website for booking hotel rooms, the aggregator receives revenue from the partner.**

**Objective of this analysis is**
* To understand existing patterns in the web data across different platforms
* To assess the impact of a couple of changes on their website during the months of Feb & Apr done using traditional AB testing by measuring different KPIs that are important for the business

**Analysis**

Focus is to address below questions that will enable the business to take strategic actions accordingly. Two separate analyses are done.

**1. Data Exploration**

* What is the most valuable platform? Why?
* What are the global and platform average revenue per click?
* Do you find any trend in the data?
* Which relation do you think exists between clicks and bookings? And what about visits and bookings? Which one would you consider as more valuable KPI?

**2. A/B test analysis**

For each of the 2 tests:
* Which metrics would you use to evaluate the performance of the test group?
* Can you summarise the performance of the tests?
* What would be your recommendation regarding the decision for the test? (and why?)
  * Roll-out the new feature to all users immediately
  * Develop the feature further before testing again
  * Run the test for a longer period of time
